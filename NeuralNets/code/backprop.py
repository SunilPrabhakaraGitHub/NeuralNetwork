backprop
~~~~~~~~

A module to implement the stochastic gradient descent learning
algorithm for a neural network.  Gradients are calculated using
backpropagation.  Note that I have focused on making the code simple,
easily readable, and easily modifiable.  It is not optimized, and
omits many desirable features.
